        If you want to achieve your goals, you have to make them S.M.A.R.T. goals.
        S.M.A.R.T. goals are attainable goals!
      </p>

          Vague goals can’t be reached. A vague goal is: “To make lots of money” or “To
          have a successful school career.” What do you mean by “lots of money” or “success”? The
          clearer you can make your goals, the better. Clear goals make the whole planning
          process a lot easier than vague, fuzzy aims.

        <summary>M - Measurable</summary>
        <p class="lead text-white">
          There is a saying: “What gets measured gets done”. Nothing is truer than when it comes
          to achieving your goals. There has to be some way to measure your progress. Basically,
          all this means is a way of answering the question: “How are we doing?” Most often goals
          are measurable in rands or units.

        <summary>A - Achievable</summary>
        <p class="lead text-white">
          Business goals have to be achievable because if they aren't
          achievable given the resources and the conditions, then those
          responsible for achieving them will be frustrated no matter how
          hard they try and eventually your goals will be ignored.

        <summary>R - Responsibility</summary>
        <p class="lead text-white">
          Goals have to be someone’s responsibility. They’re not likely
          to be achieved if they are just a vague “something” that
          “everyone” must “somehow” do. Unless you are a solo act, they should be the collective
          or the individual responsibility of other people. They can’t all be your responsibility. This
          is a good time to delegate... which means trusting people to do the job!
        </p>

      <details>
        <summary>T - Time-based</summary>
        <p class="lead text-white">
          Goals have to have a deadline. Not only must you know what you have to do to achieve
          each goal, you must know when you are will do it. However, keep in mind that your
          deadlines must be flexible. This means they must be able to shrink and expand
          according to how things are going. But beware of deadlines so flexible that they
          disappear altogether!
