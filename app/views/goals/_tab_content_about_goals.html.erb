      <summary>What is a Goal?</summary>
        <p class="lead">
          A goal is something that a person or a group of people may want to
          achieve or attain at some point in the future. People endeavor to reach goals
          within a finite time by setting deadlines.

      <summary>What is a To Do list?</summary>
      <p class="lead text-white">
        A to do list is a list of things you need to do, i.e. actions, in order
        to achieve a specific goal. The idea is too brainstorm a list by
        writing down every single action you need to do in order to achieve your goal.
      </p>

      <summary>What is an Action Plan?</summary>
      <p class="lead text-white">
        Most of us know we need to make “To Do” lists! However, not many of us know we
        need to turn our “To Do” lists into action plans.
      </p>
      <p class="lead text-white">
        An action plan converts a “To Do” list into a step-by-step approach for action.
      </p>
      <p class="lead text-white">
        Action plans bring order to your life because once you’ve formulated a sound plan,
        you are free to stop worrying because everything you have to do is planned out
        with the correct deadlines.

      <summary>Turning “To Do” lists into “Action Plans”</summary>
      <p class="lead text-white">Brainstorm a “To Do” list</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Write down every single action you need to do in order to complete a particular
          section of this journal. Remember: no action is too small to write down.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="lead text-white">Cross out all the unnecessary items</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Ask yourself: “Does this action clearly contribute to my business?” If it doesn’t,
          cross it out. It’s that simple!
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="lead text-white">Prioritise your list</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Number the items on your list in the order you must do them, according to:
          <ul class="lower-alpha">
            <li>their importance and</li>
            <li>the time needed to complete the task.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p class="lead text-white">Assign responsibility</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Each action has to be someone’s responsibility.
        </li>
        <li>
          Things won’t get done if they are just something
          that someone must do.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p class="lead text-white">Assign a deadline</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Actions must have a deadline.
        </li>
        <li>
          Write down exactly when each task will be done -
          then stick to that deadline, no compromises!
        </li>
      </ul>
