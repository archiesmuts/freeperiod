Admissions Details
We understand that your school has established specific Admission requirements.   So we designed the Admissions module in MyStudentsProgress.com to be flexible enough to work with your schools current Admissions process.    This module is designed exclusively for your Admissions department and enables you to track every student and their current status in the admissions process.



Admission Module features and benefits:

    Integration– MyStudentsProgress.com provides integration between the Prospects and Admissions module, allowing for a seamless transition from online inquires from your schools website to student enrollment.  We also reduce your schools administrative costs by providing a roll-over feature from the admission process to student enrollment.
    Flexibility- Schools have the ability to create, name and track an unlimited number of their schools Admissions phases.   Profile pages are also created for each applicant to track all contact information and lists current phases.
    Communication- Our integrated email and ad-hoc reporting features make it easy to keep parents and staff informed about all Admission department activities.  This communication process allows your Admission department to send newsletters to parent’s, send out updates about the school or simply create an email to make parents aware of their students Admission status.
