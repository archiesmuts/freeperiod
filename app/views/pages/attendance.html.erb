Attendance

Attendance is one of those administrative tasks that must be done at the start of each class. It can take up valuable time at the beginning of class and sometimes be difficult to manage. Attendance books traditionally are big grids with tiny squares that are hard to read and can be easy to make errors in. With QuickSchools' Online Student Information System (also known as Online School Management System), taking and managing attendance is no longer a hassle with our easy to use and robust school attendance system.

The easy to use online student attendance system designed by QuickSchools make taking attendance quick and less prone to errors. Record a student’s attendance on the colored chart with a click of the mouse. The information pertaining to the student attendance can then be immediately shared with parents via cloud (i.e., online) to help them keep track of their students via our online school management system.

Easy to Read Pages

With our online school management system, working with an attendance chart has never been so easy. Colorful headers; wide, shaded rows; and a clean, large font make reading your class attendance rooster easier than ever. Online attendance is more efficient for teachers, too. Simply click a button to indicate a student’s presence or absence. No more trying to make a small mark in an even smaller square. The bright and clean pages make managing and maintaining your attendance records a breeze.
Online Parent Tracking

Another fantastic benefit of QuickSchool’s attendance feature is that the students attendance information is available to parents immediately. Once a teacher saves the attendance record for the period, QuickSchools automatically posts the attendance information to the appropriate Parent Portal without any further action from teachers. Parents can check in with the school through the Parent Portal once a day, once a week, or even period-by-period to ensure their students are attending their classes.

It is another way that QuickSchools helps keep parents actively involved in their student’s education.
