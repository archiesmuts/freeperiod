Attendance Details
With our web-based Attendance Module, your school no longer has to keep track of hand-written attendance slips.  Once attendance is entered in our Attendance Module, school administrators can view instant daily reports regarding student absences and tardies. We provide each school a powerful yet simple attendance process that tracks student attendance in real-time for school administrators, teachers and parents.   Our attendance module works for any size school and any attendance code format.
