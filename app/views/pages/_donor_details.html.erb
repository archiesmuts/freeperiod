Donor Details
The Donor module is fully integrated with your MyStudentsProgress.com database.  This database integration provides your school access to current parents, historical parents, alumni’s or corporate donor data. This historical data integration eliminates redundant data entry for your fund development department and provides easy access to potential donors without maintaining a separate donor database.

MyStudentsProgress.com has over 10 years of experience in fund development software.  This allows us to take sole source responsibility for all data conversion, programming and technical support.  We never outsource to any outside company so our clients do not have to deal with custom interfaces between two products or have to maintain and update separate databases.



Donor Module features and benefits:

    Conversion- We provide FREE data conversion for any Donor Data that you provide to us electronically.  This includes setting up a donor profile page for each record.
    Relationship Tracking- We’ve made tracking donor relationships easy!  Schools have the ability to add an unlimited number of donor relationship fields and report on this information at the click of a button.
    Setup Appeals – Your school can create and track an unlimited number of appeals and commitments.
    Communicate with Donors– We make it easy to personalize mass mailings or emails to make a great impression on your potential donors.  All communication history is automatically linked to the individual donor profile page.
    Reporting Donor Information– Running reports on any information in the Donor Module is simple.  Our easy to use point and click ad hoc reporting allows you to run reports on any data field in your Donor database.  As an example, you can easily run:

        Donations by Appeal
        Total Donations
