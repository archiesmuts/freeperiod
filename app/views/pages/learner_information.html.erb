Interactive Student Database

Student information has never been so easy to manage with our robust student information system. QuickSchools is an interactive database of student information that is easily accessible and always available for qualified staff. It ensures that all administrators and teachers to have access to the most recent student information. The student database includes basic information including address, sibling names and grades, parents, and contact information. This database is linked to all of the student’s school classes and activities. Additional information regarding billing, accounts, and medical history are easily added by administration.

The interactive student database available via the QuickSchools Student Information System is the backbone of a student’s journey through education. During the school year all of the student’s teachers enter information about grades, homework, attendance, discipline, and achievements into the same electronic file so that a student’s records are always complete and up to date.

Administrators and Teachers

With QuickSchools and the interactive student database, administrators and teachers are always on the same page. The student database keeps all information together in a single repository so that it is not scattered across teachers and the front office. Because all information is stored together, administrators and teachers can quickly gather the recent and relevant information they need in one place, including class schedules, disciplinary problems, grading, and outstanding payments. This makes information gathering more efficient and productive since it eliminates the need to contact all of the student’s teachers and search for various student files.
Parents

Parents, too, benefit from the student database. Basic information can be updated online instead of needing to make a special trip to the office to fill out paperwork. School billing and account management is hassle-free since it can be monitored and paid online. Perhaps the biggest benefit for parents is the ability to keep track of their student’s grades, attendance, and homework on a daily basis, which makes it easy to keep track of their student’s academic progress.
