We don’t stop at software.

MSP is a powerful software platform, but we provide a whole lot more than software: Customized setup specific for your school, all the training you need, top-tier hosting, industry-standard security and more.
Customized System Setup

We assign a dedicated team member to assist in converting your school’s existing data to the MSP platform. We match your school’s terminology, grading system, and report card formats and create electronic cumulative folders for your students with the specific information you require. We guarantee that our system is flexible enough to meet your specific needs.
Unlimited Support & Training

Implementing a SIS at your school can result in big changes in how your school functions and how teachers interact with their classes. Don’t be left in the dark with a system you don’t understand or know how to use. Our experienced and attentive support team will give you all the training and support you need to ensure you and your staff are confident and ready to maximize your experience with MSP with unlimited support requests by phone and email.
Top-tier hosting

Our goal is to make sure MSP runs at peak performance. That’s why we’ve selected CenturyLink as our hosting partner. CenturyLink is an industry-recognized leader for delivering managed hosting services to enterprises as well as state, local and federal government. CenturyLink’s Managed Hosting Services are located within its more than 55 global data center facilities, designed to provide state-of-the-art hosting for mission-critical environments, connected to CentryLink’s 100Gbps global backbone, and include multiple levels of physical security, 24/7 First Touch Response support, on-site technical staff, SAS 70 II certification and PCI DSS compliance.
Industry-standard security

We understand that the data you trust us with is often of sensitive nature. Consequently, protecting that data is one of our upmost priorities. We implement a number of security measures as part of our robust Information Security Policy to protect your data, such as: internal network anti-virus protection, firewalls to protect unauthorized or brute-force access, and SSL encryption that ensures your data is not intercepted when traveling between your computer and our servers.
