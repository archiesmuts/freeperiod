Parent Portal

One of the most powerful features of QuickSchools is the Parent Portal. The parent portal enables parents to be connected to their student’s classroom and teachers 24 hours a day. This feature keeps parents involved and actively participating in their student’s education. The information available to parents in the parent portal is completely customizable by the school and can include attendance records, grades, classroom assignments, calendars, a message board, and basic student and parent information.

Tracking Progress

Parents usually have to rely on students for school and classroom information, such as notes from the teacher, homework assignments, activities, and classroom policies. To a lesser degree, parents must wait for students to bring home classroom and school notes and letters regarding attendance, grades, and requests for teacher meetings. With the Parent Portal, parents don’t have to wait and hope that their students will give them the materials they need in order to stay informed. Instead, parents can get the information they want themselves right from their own computer and that information comes straight from the teachers and school. Information in the parent portal is always up to date, which is especially important for attendance and grading tracking.

The Parent Portal also relieves teachers of the constant requests for progress and attendance reports. The Parent portal is updated daily by QuickSchools.
Open Communications

Sometimes parents and students have questions that must be addressed before the start of the next school day, especially if they are questions regarding homework, testing, and projects due the next day. Parents may also want to touch base with their student’s teachers if they have questions, suggestions, or comments regarding classroom activities, attendance, discipline issues, or grades. The Parent Portal includes a communications feature which enables parents to send private messages directly to their student’s teachers. This direct line of communication can help parents and teachers ensure the success of their students.
